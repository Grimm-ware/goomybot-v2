User Interactions Design: 

user -> usersPokemon
   each pokemon a user catches will be given their id and stored in a seperate collection to the user
   at any one time only the current pokemon is loaded into memory
   Features: 
   when the user uses the box command, return a paginated list of pokemon they own (set by users filter) 
   User can filter list by: shiny, dex number, favorites, level, name, region
   User can check pokedex to find missing pokemon (by region as well)

user -> moves
   Features: 
      User can get list of moves their current pokemon can learn (paginated) 
      User can teach their pokemon any move on the previous list (conditions?)
      If user has TM of move the cost is free? 

user -> items
   Features: 
      User can take/give item from current Pokemon
      Get list of items user currently has, filterable by pocket?
      Need list of items that user can obtain and in which region?
      Where can items be used?
      What additional items need to be added for game specific mechanics
